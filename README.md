# Random Music Note

## Description

A web page I created when I started playing a musical instrument. It randomly suggests a note to play, helping you reinforce your knowledge of how to play the notes, improving your speed and reaction time. You should already have a basic understanding of how to play the note because it won't tell you if you're wrong. It's just more random than if you or someone else were to choose the notes.

## Feature Updates

1. Initially, random notes were displayed only in solfège notation, with the interface already optimized for tablets.

2. Added alphabetic notation and an interval feature, so you no longer need to click/tap to get a new note.

3. Implemented voice synthesis, so you don’t have to look at the screen anymore (and also because it was fun to explore the API).
